A logical approach is to evenly distribute this extra mileage across the available training days, focusing on sessions where it is feasible to add volume. The easiest way is to increase the long run slightly and a couple of easy runs. For example, the long run on Saturday could be increased by 2.0 miles to 18.5 miles, and the easy run on Sunday could be increased by 1.0 miles to 5.5 miles. This would result in an additional 3.0 miles. We can then increase Thursday's easy run by 1.0 mile to reach exactly 36.0 miles left to run.\",\n",
