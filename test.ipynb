Wednesdays appear to be ideal for your workouts as you log higher mileage with a pace of 9m 20s per mile, suggesting potential for speed work on this day. Your lighter runs and potential rest days could be on Sundays, allowing for recovery post long runs., weekly_mileage_target=For the upcoming week, let's aim for a target weekly mileage of around 47 miles. Your longest run should range between 16 to 17 miles, ensuring a gradual increase without overexertion.
