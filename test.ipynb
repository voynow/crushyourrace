This leaves us with 29 to 31 miles to cover during the rest of the week. \\n\\nFor continuous mid-week workouts, we'll plan a speed workout on Wednesday for a total of 7 miles including warm-up, cool-down, and intervals at 10k pace such as 4x1 mile repeats. \\n\\nThis leaves us with 22 to 24 miles to distribute across the remaining days. \\n\\nSunday is typically a rest day or very light running day, so a rest day could be beneficial here. We'll aim for easy runs of 5 miles on Monday and Tuesday, a moderate run of 6 miles on Thursday, a light 3-mile easy run on Friday, and the long run on Saturday. Revisiting the numbers:\\n- Monday: 5 miles (easy) \\n- Tuesday: 5 miles (easy) \\n- Wednesday: Speed workout including 4x1 mile @ 10k pace totaling 7 miles \\n- Thursday: 6 miles (moderate) \\n- Friday: 3 miles (easy) \\n- Saturday: Long run of 16 miles \\n- Sunday: Rest or optional 1-mile recovery jog\\n\\nWeekly mileage total is 42 miles, slightly under target.
