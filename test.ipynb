You seem to rest primarily on Thursdays with only one short run logged, which could serve as a rest or recovery day. Your preferred long run day is Saturday (6 runs, 10.17 miles, 9m 59s/mile), which aligns with your preference. Wednesdays show a focus on shorter runs (11 runs, 4.76 miles, 9m 20s/mile), indicating this might be an ideal day for speed work or tempo runs to further enhance your performance. Sundays have fewer longer runs (2 runs, 8.04 miles, 9m 27s/mile), which might either serve as a backup long run day or additional flexible mileage.',\n",
       " 'weekly_mileage_target': \"Based on your recent training summaries, you have shown a consistent and progressive increase in your weekly mileage as well as in the distance of your longest run, which is excellent preparation for your second marathon. Your weekly mileage has increased from 28.7 miles in Week 25 to 40.19 miles in Week 31, with your longest run extending from 8.45 miles to 14.03 miles. This gradual build-up is crucial for endurance and injury prevention. Given this steady progression, I recommend a slight increase in mileage for next week. Target a weekly mileage of around 42 miles, with a long run of approximately 15 miles on Saturday. This will help you continue to build your endurance while allowing some recovery time after such consistent increases. Keep your Wednesday workouts consistent to maintain your mid-week strength and stamina. Great job, and let's keep this momentum going!\"}"
