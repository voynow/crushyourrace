The current plan for the rest of the week adds up to 27.0 miles (5.0 + 5.0 + 17.0 + 0.0). To achieve the required mileage, we need to add 1.83 miles to the weekly plan. Since the client prefers long runs on Saturdays, we could add this to the long run by extending it to 18.83 miles. Alternatively, we could spread the extra mileage across easy run days. I will choose the option to extend the Saturday long run by 1.83 miles because the client is training for a marathon and it is typical to have more volume on these runs. Additionally, I will redistribute 0.17 miles from either Thursday or Friday to fine-tune the plan so that these adjustments won't cause an excessive leap in effort on any single day.\",\n",
