${past_7_days}

Today's activities (${day_of_week}):
${activities_from_today}

Write concise, actionable feedback (2-3 sentences) about today's activity, framed in the context of their recent performance and goals. Prioritize insights that are:
- Non-obvious or data-driven, offering unique perspectives or patterns from their activities.
- Encouraging or challenging, balancing motivation with constructive critique.

Assume their goals based on the data if not explicitly stated, and focus on what's most impactful for their progress. Avoid AI-like phrasing or generic statementsâ€”write as a professional coach speaking directly to the athlete.

Notes:
- Do not use the client's name
- For rest days, keep the feedback extremely brief (1 sentence max)"""
