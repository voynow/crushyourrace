## Principles: Building the Future of Running with TrackFlow

1. **AI Will Outperform Human Coaches**  
   We are placing a bet on AI surpassing the capabilities of human coaching within the next 5â€“10 years. This eliminates the need for cookie-cutter training plans or reliance on human input, enabling truly personalized coaching at scale.

2. **The Cost of Intelligence Will Plummet**  
   We are confident that the cost of intelligence will continue to fall dramatically. By leveraging this trend, TrackFlow is poised to deliver elite-level coaching to every runner, at a fraction of the cost of our competitors.

3. **Volume Over Pace**  
   Our philosophy prioritizes training volume, not pace. Pace determination is a somewhat solved problem through heart rate training analytics. While advanced pace prediction is possible, it is not our focus. Our mission is clear: empower runners with smarter volume-driven training plans, where AI can dynamically allocate volume appropriately.

Join us in shaping the future of training. Let's run smarter, together.
